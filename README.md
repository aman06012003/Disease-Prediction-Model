# Disease-Prediction-Model
ML model to predict diseases using some symptoms like Blood Pressure, Sugar level etc.
As the data is large so I used Random Forest Classfier to build the model.
Random Forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub samples of the dataset and uses the averaging to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.
The main reason of using random forest is because the data was categorical with over 40 different categories
